This includes ontology-based query expansion in the public interface and curator\r\ntools for annotating studies as they are entered into the GWAS catalog.\r\n\r\nBelow is some developer information for working with the code held in this git repository.\r\n\r\n## Git vs. SVN\r\n\r\nWe've opted to use git as the SCM for this project, and host the source code on GitHub.  The main motivation for this\r\nis to enable us to use GitHub rather than sourceforge as our hosting site - it is much faster and provides better\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about GitHub is that is provides access to the project sourcecode via git or SVN: so if you are not used\r\nto working with git you can still contribute using SVN.\r\n\r\nTo obtain copies of the project source, use the following commands:\r\n\r\nGit:\r\n\r\n git clone https://github.com/ebispot/goci\r\n\r\nSVN:\r\n\r\n svn checkout https://github.com/ebispot/goci\r\n\r\nYou can push changes back to the GitHub repository using the normal mechanism for either git or SVN.\r\n\r\n## Maven Structure\r\n\r\nThe GWAS Ontology and Curation Infrastructure (GOCI) is organised into several main strands: tools for working with the\r\nontology, tools for enhancing curation activities, and tools to generate a diagram of GWAS catalog data.\r\n\r\n### GOCI Core\r\n\r\nThis module hosts the core classes underlying the GOCI tooling suite. It includes sub-modules for the key model objects that GOCI is based on, repository and service modules for accessing the data model and modules for diagram generation and interacting with ontologies.\r\n\r\n### GOCI Interfaces\r\n\r\nThis module includes all the different ways to interface with the GWAS Catalog. It includes modules for the curation system, the public GWAS Catalog portal, the diagram generation service and a place holder module with some config for the GWAS Solr index.\r\n\r\n\r\n### GOCI Tools\r\n\r\nThis module contains a range of stand-alone tools, including a datapublisher to convert the relational GWAS database into RDF/OWL, a mapper to annotate Catalog data with genomic context information from Ensembl via their REST API, a Solr indexer to load the database into a Solr index, as well as a range of util classes and one-off tools used for analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n### GOCI Parent & GOCI Dependencies\r\n\r\nThese are convenience modules used for dependency management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Building this Project\r\n\r\nThis project is built with Maven (http://maven.apache.org) so make sure you have an up-to-date installation of Maven\r\nbefore proceeding.\r\n\r\nCheck out the source code as described above, change to the root GOCI directory and run\r\n\r\n mvn clean install\r\n\r\nto build all binaries of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
